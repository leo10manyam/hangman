How to Play Hangman
Objective
The goal of Hangman is to guess a hidden word, one letter at a time, before you run out of attempts. Each incorrect guess reduces your remaining chances, so think carefully before each guess!

Steps to Play
Start the Game

When the game begins, a word is chosen at random and represented by underscores (_) for each letter. For example, if the word is "PYTHON," it will display as:
_ _ _ _ _ _
Make a Guess

Enter a letter that you think might be in the word.
If the letter is correct, it will be revealed in its correct positions in the word.
If the letter is incorrect, you lose one attempt.
Repeat Guesses

Keep guessing letters one at a time.
If you repeat a letter you've already guessed, the game will prompt you to try a different letter.
The game will show you the current progress of the word and how many attempts you have left.
Winning the Game

If you guess all the letters correctly before running out of attempts, you win! The game will display a message like:
arduino

Congratulations! You guessed the word: PYTHON
Losing the Game

If you run out of attempts without guessing the word, you lose. The game will reveal the correct word and display a message like:
vbnet

Sorry, you've run out of attempts! The word was: PYTHON
Example Gameplay

Sorry, you've run out of attempts! The word was: APPLE
Tips
Start by guessing common vowels (like A, E) and frequently used consonants (like T, N).
Avoid repeating letters to save your attempts.
Use clues from correctly guessed letters to figure out possible words.
Enjoy playing Hangman and try to improve your guessing strategy each time!
